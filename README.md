## Saliency maps
  - The saliency maps can be approached in [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hiyfxwcX0XOhR3n0Kgv5Kw) (fetach code is bida). Note that all testing results are provided not only including those listed in the paper.

## Evaluation tools
- The evaluation tools, training and test datasets can be obtained in [RGBD-SOD-tools](https://github.com/kingkung2016/RGBD-SOD-tools).
